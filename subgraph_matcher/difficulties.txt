The methods can be sorted into 2 parts according to patterns mining manner:
1) off-line (preset of patterns)
2) on-line patterns extraction from the analyzed graphs, for ex., by clustering

The main difficulties while on-line mathching are:

1) design space combinatorial explosion; there are 2^k subgraphs in graph of k nodes. So, to avoid exponential complexity, some heuristics and constraints should be applied both for procedure of patterns execution and graphs mining

2) classes of graphs: let it be DAGs, for successfull topological sort applying. Moreover, the isomorphism problem is less difficult for this class of graphs, that for graph in general.

3) connectivity. Does pattern should be one-component connected, or there can be k-graphs? 

4) overlapping. How to split and cover the overlapped subgraphs?
